## üñ•Ô∏è **What is the Viterbi Algorithm Visualizer?**
The **Viterbi Algorithm Visualizer** brings learning to life by letting you step through how the Viterbi algorithm works for POS tagging. With support for **English**, **Swedish**, and **Korean**, this tool demonstrates the algorithm‚Äôs effectiveness across diverse linguistic structures.

---

## ‚ú® **Features**
- **Interactive Visualization**: Observe the Viterbi algorithm in action as it computes the most probable sequence of POS tags for any given sentence.  
- **Multilingual Support**: Switch between English, Swedish, or Korean datasets to explore how linguistic differences impact the algorithm.  
- **Accuracy Metrics**:
  - **English**: 91.3%  
  - **Swedish**: 90.2%  
  - **Korean**: 79.2%  
- **Educational Focus**: Ideal for anyone curious about HMMs and sequence tagging.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**
The visualizer employs the **Viterbi algorithm**, a dynamic programming technique that predicts the most probable POS tag sequence for a sentence. Key components include:

- **Transition & Emission Probabilities**: Generated from annotated datasets in English, Swedish, and Korean.  
- **Final Output**: Presents the sentence annotated with predicted POS tags.

---

## üìö **Data Sources**
This project extends the foundational work in [PartOfSpeech](https://github.com/emma-horton/PartsOfSpeech), using its pretrained models and datasets. The corpora used for POS tagging were preprocessed and trained to achieve high accuracy rates:

- **English**: 91.3%  
- **Swedish**: 90.2%  
- **Korean**: 79.2%

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Future Improvements**
The following enhancements are planned for future iterations of the visualizer:  

- **Dynamic Programming Table**: Display step-by-step calculations of probabilities to improve user understanding.  
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Introduce more intuitive controls and visual cues.  
- **Expanded Language Support**: Add new languages with unique linguistic structures.
